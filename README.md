## Precare ML
### Predicting Cardiovascular Events Using Machine Learning


Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death worldwide. Underlying atherosclerosis and
ensuing conditions such as myocardial infarction, ischemic heart disease and stroke cause
tremendous morbidity, mortality and economic loss.
Early identification of patients at high risk for such clinical events enables preventive actions. The
use of machine learning (ML) for risk prediction can outperform traditional risk scores. Although
many ML models have been developed over the last years, validation is rare. We do not yet know
how models perform in different clinical settings or populations. Furthermore, as models use
numerous and diverse predictors, it is hard to transfer models to other health systems.
Recently, we developed risk prediction models for major adverse cardiovascular events and
progression of kidney disease. However, the models lack external validation, hindering
implementation in different clinical contexts and limiting generalizability.
As such, this project has three main aims. First, we aim to validate and improve our ML models
across different hospital networks and populations. Second, we aim to integrate ML models in
different hospital information systems and evaluate their impact on daily hospital routine. Third,
building upon these validated models, we aim to address effective risk communication strategies
in order to effect behavioural changes in patients.
Therefore, our project makes a fundamental contribution towards employing innovative
personalized risk prediction and to assess its clinical implementation in a transnational context.
